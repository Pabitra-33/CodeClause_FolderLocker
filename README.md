# CodeClause_FolderLocker
Created a folder locker window based app using java swing and awt components, this app can enable functions to lock a folder after the user browse and select the folder he/she wants to lock,after locking it add one .lock file inside the locked folder, so that it helps the user to understand that it's a locked folder and he can not use it until the required actions are not completed in this folder, and after that if he wants he can unlock this folder by selecting the path.
